One is a transmitter, which is worn on the user\u2019s wrist. The second is the receiver, which is attached to the communication device using a micro USB cable. The transmitter detects a gesture and then communicates this to the receiver micro:bit. The receiver says \u2018There\u2019s been a gesture!\u2019 to the communications device. Software running on the communications device then emulates the F1 (function key 1) being pressed and released. Grid 3 reacts to this as if a physical keyboard had just had the F1 key pressed and released.</p> <p>The software that runs on the communication device runs on both Windows and Linux. I realise that the communications software in common use only runs on Windows. I would like it if communications software also ran on Linux, so the least I could do was make my system run on Linux. I don\u2019t have a Mac to test the system with. This is on my \u2018to do\u2019 list.</p>"},{"location":"#safety","title":"Safety","text":"<p>The BBC micro:bit was designed to be safe to use in education with 11-12 year-olds, so has safety designed in.</p> <p>The transmitter board is powered by two AAA batteries in a case.

You can alter the sensitivity of the system by using the buttons on either the transmitter or the receiver. Or both. This means that the transmitter can be in use and you can alter the shake detection threshold without having to interfere with whoever is using it.</p> <p>Pushing the button labelled \u2018a\u2019 causes a \u2018-\u2018 symbol to appear briefly on the transmitter\u2019s LEDs. This makes it easier for a gentle shake to be detected. Each time you press the button a single faint LED will turn off and remain off and the sensitivity to a shake is increased.</p> <p>Pushing the button labelled \u2018b\u2019 will make a \u2018+\u2019 symbol appear on the LED. This will make it harder for a gentle shake to be detected. Each time you press the button, a single faint LED will be lit and remain lit. You will need to shake the board harder to get it to trigger.</p> Button A press. The board now needs a gentler shake before it sends a trigger. Button B press. The board now needs a harder shake before it sends a trigger. <p>The micro:bit radio is set to use one of the 65,000 channel and group combinations available to it. Two micro:bit handshake systems could interfere. Fixing this interference requires changing a couple of lines of code in the transmitter and receiver scripts for one of the systems, to have it use a different channel or group. If you are using multiple handshake systems in the same area, send me an email and I will send out some code with a different channel and group configuration. Or, as the microbit is deployed to year 7 in UK schools \u2013 ask a friendly 12-year old to do this!
